# Tibetan_places
This repo contains three files with lists of foreign toponyms, foreign anthroponyms, and Tibetan names as found in Tibetan language newspapers in the 1950s and 1960s.

The Divergent Discourses corpus of modern Tibetan newspapers

## Diverge Foreign Anthroponyms
The file contains non-Tibetan anthroponyms alongside their original and Chinese forms and lists their various forms in Tibetan. Occasionally, links to corresponding entries in the [Integrated Authority File](https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html) are added.

## Diverge Tibetan Anthroponyms
The list contains Tibetan anthroponyms with their corresponding Chinese and English forms. Different from the other two lists, the names here are general forms and not the names of historical figures. The list was built with the consent of the compilers from a list published on [High Peaks Pure Earth](https://highpeakspureearth.com/tibetan-names-in-simplified-chinese-1/).
